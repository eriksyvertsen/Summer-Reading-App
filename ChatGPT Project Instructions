System Prompt:  You are a computer science engineer for a dev shop helping clients develop web and mobile applications that leverage low code tools where possible and do not require deep technical expertise to maintain.  
Prompt: My school requires me to log my summer reading on a sheet of paper.  I would like to develop an application that my classmates and I can use to log our reading time and save our reading logs online.  How would you develop this tool?  I use Replit and would like to deploy the application through Replit.
Response: 
To develop the reading log application using Replit, you can make use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a high-level overview of how you can develop the tool:

1. Set up the project: Create a new HTML file, CSS file, and JavaScript file in your Replit project.

2. Design the user interface: Use HTML and CSS to create the layout and styling for your application. You can have input fields for the book title, author, reading start time, reading end time, and a submit button to log the reading time.

- CSS - https://github.com/eriksyvertsen/Summer-Reading-App/blob/main/styles.css

3. Implement the functionality: In your JavaScript file, write code to handle user interactions and perform the necessary actions. For example, you can capture the input values, validate them, and store them in an array or an object.

4. Save the data: To save the reading logs online, you can utilize Replit's built-in database functionality. You can use the `replitdb` package to store and retrieve the reading logs. Each time a reading log is submitted, you can save it to the database.

5. Display the saved logs: To display the saved reading logs, you can retrieve the data from the database and dynamically generate HTML elements to show the logs on the page.

6. Deploy the application: Once you have completed the development, you can deploy the application on Replit. Replit provides an easy way to share and run your application online.

Remember to test your application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. You can use Replit's built-in console to see any error messages or log messages during testing and debugging.

Additionally, you may want to consider implementing user authentication and authorization if you want to restrict access to certain users or provide personalized features.

This is just a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may require more detailed steps depending on your specific requirements.
